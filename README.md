# MLsem

Our test corpuses are in the directory `tests`.
Each corpus uses the extension `.ml` because the syntax is close to OCaml's syntax,
but it is not valid OCaml code. 

## Building and running the native version

The [OCaml Package Manager](https://opam.ocaml.org/) must be installed first.

```
opam switch create mlsem 5.3.0
eval $(opam env --switch=mlsem)
make deps
make
```

This will run the native version of the prototype and
type-check the definitions in the directory `tests`.

## Testing the Wasm version

The WebAssembly version is about 10x slower than the native version, but can be tested directly in the web browser with an interface based on [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).  
It can be directly tested online [here](https://e-sh4rk.github.io/MLsem/) or built from sources:

```
make wasm
cd webeditor
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

MLsem should then be accessible from your web browser: http://localhost:8080/  
You can load examples by pressing F2 or accessing the contextual menu (right click).

## Documentation

Documentation can be accessed [here](https://e-sh4rk.github.io/MLsem/doc/).
It can also be generated from source:

```
make doc
```

This will generate the documentation in `webeditor/doc/`.
